#Monday
Everyone showed up!  We started strong on Monday morning with all 20
of the participants, Kronda, myself, Debbie, and Dino and we got to work first
by drafting a final version of the attendance expectations that everyone 
would feel comfortable signing.

We then did a designed alliance - which means everyone gets to speak out
about what they needed from our shared space to be able to learn and feel
safe being here.  We have those [agreements][agreements] digitized now and they are located
in the repo.

Debbie was here in Portland for the first day and a half and she helped run
the Strengths Finder portion.  This involved having the cohort do an online
quiz at the [Gallup Strength Finder][strength_finder] site and then
each person gets a custom list of their top 5 strengths.  These were the starting
point for our getting to know each other, as our strengths and what they mean to us.

Something I learned was that instead of just telling people why I chose to start
us off with this particular exercise, instead I asked the room "Why do you think 
we started with this?" and amazingly, everything I would have told them came
out from them.

At the end of the first day, many expressed their appreciation for the work 
on strengths and yet several seemed nervous that we hadn't just dived right in
to high level coding.  I try to assure them it will happen, we're not going to
rush things. There's a lot more to this course in terms of preparation and
community building with each other that will be needed to make us strong going
forward.

#Tuesday
After a night of sitting with their newly listed out and described strengths
our cohort started day 2 by choosing one of those strengths where they felt 
the word wasn't interesting enough or accurately descriptive of their sense of the 
strength so that they could go and rename it something that was more compelling.

The next activity was to start checking out what Mozilla offers potential contributors
coming in from outside.  We did two activities around this.  The first was to break into
groups of 3 or 4 and look into a series of questions about that particular tool/community.
(photo upload needed here).  Then that afternoon the groups presented back to the room 
what they'd come to learn about each area.  We invited the Portland office folks to join
if they were interested.  There were some great questions, some useful feedback provided, 
and everyone got their first presentation to a larger group out of the way. This is
useful because we'll be doing a lot of presentations during the course of this program.

Following the group work, we had a bunch of supposedly 5-10 minute contribution
possibilities that had been surfaced from the research.  The participants were
told they had 10 minutes to go and make an individual contribution to Mozilla.
Needless to say, very few people were able to complete a contribution.  Creating accounts,
finding the task to complete, selecting something that would indeed be a short task, many 
barriers to doing a quick contribution for the first timer.  The most successful
project to one-and-done with was MDN.  That has a great path for new people to edit or tag
articles which is handy for people with previous experience in copy editing, wiki use,
and general language proficiency.  Second up was the Twitter Army of Awesome that SUMO
created.  One participant was able to do that as a quickie contribution.

#Wednesday
Everyone did a great job presenting yesterday but because it all took more time than
anticipated, we moved learning git and some of the basic command line stuff to today.
I did a [hack][hack] on our project site and after we taught how to use terminal,
moving around in a text-based environment we moved to git and everyone cloned
the [ascend project repo][ascendrepo] and got to work learning how to undo the hack.

#Thursday
Badges!  One of the best moments on this day was having each participant create
a badge to give all the others - celebrating their successes so far. You can see those
[badges][badges] where some have been tagged with 'ascend' to help people find them. We're going to use badges throughout the program not only from mentor->student but also
between students themselves in order to capture the trajectory people find for themselves.

This day was the first day where the energy really dipped.  We got in the weeds with git & command lines and having a 2:20 teacher:student ratio.  I'm not going to lie - that was the hardest day and I'm learning
a lot about how to set up the daily agendas as a result.  In preparation for Friday
I included a lot more detail to try and help people have more at their fingertips during the day.

#Friday
Our fifth day together.  This day was put aside to be a [webmaker events][webmaker] as well as
intended to provide time for blogging. We were sort of crash-landing into Friday's material which will be obvious from the agenda.  The days are long and while we're packing a lot in, it's understandable
that sometimes people max out.  So in the morning we got a little bogged down doing command line
exercises and that pushed the webmaker stuff into the afternoon. We were planning to end early for 
a little social with the Portland office and that made our afternoon an hour shorter.

For the Webmaker Maker Party we did two areas of focus. The first was to look at the 
Web Literacies and break out into pairs that went to find a skill to come back and teach the others.  There were great add-ons and recommendations you can see the [notes][web_literacies] here. I was impressed that with this second time coming up to present *everyone* had gotten
so much better about public speaking.  Then we had a little over an hour to play with the Webmaker
tools.  I asked people to spend 30 minutes with a tool trying to make something about why
they were in Ascend.  The results vary, people tried all the different options.  There are some 
great starts and some learning happened even if very rapidly.  Then there was half an hour left for blogging, pushing, and making a pull request.  Ever since the snowperson hack exercise we've done 
daily push/pull requests in order to keep this knowledge fresh in their minds.  It's working, there are
now more blog posts up and once I push this one I'm going to go get them attached to people's bios on
the participants page.
