Monday 9/22
Weekly Mozilla all hands meeting
lunch: Pacific Pie Co
Begin setting up development environment on our MacBooks per [this blog post](http://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development/). Lots of downloading, installing, configuring. Happy to be doing this with the whole group because I'd be a lot more hesitant and grumpy about all this stuff otherwise. With the group, I just do it to keep up with everybody, and i have people to ask if I run into a snag, and then it's done before I know it!

Tuesday 9/23
lunch: carts

Finished setting up dev environment with MySQL and WordPress, per yesterday’s instructions as refined in Kronda’s new blog post:

Install a local build of Firefox
This did not mean, as I first thought when I heard the term “you’re going to build Firefox,” that we were going to write code for an entire web browser from scratch. And thank goodness, because it was only allotted 45 mins in our agenda for today.
We installed a ready-to-use virtual build environment per [this great blog tutorial](http://timtaubert.de/blog/2014/04/a-ready-to-use-virtual-build-environment-for-firefox/), ran a script to build firefox nightly, ran it. That was the relatively straightforward part. The lesson (the hard part) was figuring out how to install our patch

Wednesday 9/24
morning: catch everyone up with wordpress and firefox build
begin looking into first bug
lunch:

First bug I’m considering: Bug 1068896, which I filed last week. Is still unconfirmed. Need to:
-confirm it needs doing
-find source code and relevant documentation
-figure out if it's something I can actually do
