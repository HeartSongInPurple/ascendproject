Much of Monday not very productive... all hands meeting (shout out to 3 or 4 Ascenders who have already landed code!), successful coaching session with Deb regarding recognizing internal saboteurs, claiming strengths and preparing stories for how to share strengths with potential employers. By the end of the day I got feedback from my bug mentor that I'm looking forward to deciphering and implementing.

Tuesday was amazing! [Dia Bondi](http://diabondi.com/) came in and worked with us all day on storytelling exercises and a presentation tool that we'll be able to use to craft the 5-minute presentations we're giving next week. Through improv games and organizing ideas, she taught us a pretty effective strategy which I'm excited to implement next week.

Wednesday Kronda walked us through WordPress customization. I added some plugins and modified some settings; I'm very looking forward to choosing a theme and further customizing the appearance. But meanwhile, I have a bug to move forward.

Lukas looked over my mentor's feedback on the bug with me this morning, and I got a very clear idea of what to do with the code. I was really excited to find that there was a bit more I could do with the code because originally it was just moving one line to a different line, and now there's a bit of rewriting to do, and I'm glad I get to do more. So I made the changes we discussed, and ran the automated update test, and it still doesn't appear to be working. And I can't figure out why. I tried running the test lots of different ways on different versions of Firefox (channels, as they're called), and still not getting the desired result. Will ask for a code review tomorrow.

At the end of the day we spent some time working on presentation skills using the framework Dia gave us yesterday. We paired up and recorded video of ourselves telling a short story about a pet we've had, then gave feedback to each other based on what we saw. It was pretty fun, and the receptionist Katt joined us! Katt is great and I'd been wondering if she'd ever get to participate with us on some of the stuff we're doing, so I was glad that she did today. She and I paired up for this exercise, and she gave me great feedback: I'm expressive, but I need to replace a lot of my "ands" with periods.
