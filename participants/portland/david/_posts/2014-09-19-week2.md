####recap, everyday a recap.

This week was a catch up week, We set up some local environments on our computers to allow us to view code before pushing it to the web.
which was cool beans. We also set up Mozmill in bash, so we can automate testing our Firefoxs... Firefoxi... Foxes anyway, so when dont have to
run a list of a 100 different things by hand. We will get into writing our own tests soon..ish. Overall im satisfied with the work im doing,
Im able to keep up, learn quickly and teach those next to me who fell behind. Its a rewarding experience all around and Im learning things I wouldn't
have the opportunity to teach myself.


[Heres](http://mozmill-crowd.blargon7.com/#/functional/report/0d8c97c37f5b0fd39f700fbd541c9ae6) the link to my test that I ran.
