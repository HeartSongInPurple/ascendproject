##What is Atom?

[**Atom**](https://atom.io) is a Text Editor very similar to Sublime Text but is open source, so its 100% free and mod-able.
Atom has [Themes](https://atom.io/themes) and [Packages](https://atom.io/packages) that can be downloaded and installed to allow you customize
your user experience.


##Installing Packages

**Packages** are code additions made specifically for atom that increase
functionality within the Editor, these can range from [Project Managers](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager) to
[Color Pickers](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) for CSS work and much more.

You can browse packages on the Atom [website](https://atom.io/packages), as well as search for them with in the Atom client.

* So if you have not already, go and [download](https://atom.io) and install Atom.
* Open Atom, and open the preferences menu (Atom -> Preferences)
* Open the Packages tab located on the left.

* Find the Package you are looking for and click the blue install button underneath it.


##Installing Themes

**Themes** are visual changes to the user interface, they can range from changes to locations of buttons, fonts or color changes, or a change to the chrome of the program itself.

You can browse themes on the Atom [website](https://atom.io/themes), as well as search for them with in the Atom client.

* Open Atom, and open the preferences menu (Atom -> Preferences)

* Above the search bar there are 2 drop down lists, one is the UI theme, the other is the Syntax theme. Your downloaded theme will have components in these drop down lists. Select them
and your Atom will load your theme.
