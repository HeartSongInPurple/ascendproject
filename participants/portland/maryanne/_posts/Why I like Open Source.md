#Why I like Open Source

##I am an Open Source Citizen 

	In the Open Source world I get credit for the work I have done. My name is on the project. Git Hub repos, Hackathons, blogs and wikis. If I worked on it my name is there. 

	This is not true in the academic world. There are no research papers that I can cite on a CV. I did the statistics, graphs, tables and database work for many research papers. I got no credit for my work. The principle investigators wouldn't credit my contributions. I wasn't important enough just a lowly research assistant. Twenty years of work that I can't cite.

	The open source world is different. Take Calagator.org for example. My name is on the work that I did for calagator. I did my six sigma black belt project on calagator's issue tracker.

	People are important in the open source world and they are treated like they are important with credit for their work.
