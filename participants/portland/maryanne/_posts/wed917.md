#Wednesday is take the Garbage to the Curb Day

	Today 
	I figured ways to deal with frustration. :truck:

	1. note to self to wheel the carts to the curb when I get home

	2. Reminder of steps to take when running moztrap

	*got to https://moztrap.mozilla.org/runtests/environment/5275/
	* get build info by typing about:buildconfig in browser
	*remember to have a playful approach and break things. 

	###Tomorrow is another day and command f helps find things
