#Git Computer Commands

A list that I wrote for myself to remember the order of git commands to be executed in a terminal 

window. In others words what do I type first, then second. 

git comes first. It is git something not something git. 

Open a terminal window. CD to the folder you want to be in.

git init

git clone

git status (I have found it a good idea to type git status after every git comand.)

git add

git log

git remote

git push

git checkout

git pull

What the commands are and do can be looked up on github.

##ascend comands
git pull ascend gh-pages

git push origin gh-pages
