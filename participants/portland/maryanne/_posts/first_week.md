	The hardest thing for me to learn has been how to play when coding. When I first learned how to code in FORTRAN it was using puch cards. You couldn't make a mistake. You had a limited amount of cards. A short time to use the punch card type writter. A narrow window of time to turn in your stack of cards. Then the waight time to get back a print out of your program. You had to be perfect.

	Now I can play. I can break things. Make a mess. Not get it correct the first time. And nothing bad happens. There is no spell checker in Markdown. *Whheeeee*
