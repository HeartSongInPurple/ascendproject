#How to find your your password that firefox saved

I uploaded my wordpress site down a folder. Got that fixed. Missing a file that caused a 404 error. FTP the file into the right spot. Site loaded in the wild. Tried to get into the admin side, couldn't remember my password or user name. Singed into the local version of the site. Firefox remembered the credentials and logged me in. How do I find out what Firefox used. This is how.

##Mozilla Support has a page telling you where to find your saved passwords.

[Mozilla Support](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-passwords#w_viewing-and-deleting-passwords)

	Open the menu button. It looks like three stacked lines on the far end of the browser. 

	Choose Preferences

	Click on security panel

	Then click on Save passwords and a window pops up

	Click on show passwords

	I did all this and found the user name and password.

	I have not solved my problem of getting into the admin side, but now I am using the correct password and user name.
