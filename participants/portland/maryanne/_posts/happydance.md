#Happy Dance
Today I did a happy dance to celebrate that I got toggle to work. 
Toggle 166 is adding a toggle component to webmaker-app.
I made a lot of mistakes before I got it to work.
SVG picture needed to be turned into CSS and put into index.less file.
Buttons aren't picture jpg any more. 
I forgot a comma, misspelled components and put the toggle folder in the wrong spot. 
After I got all the pieces correct, gulp dev worked and put up a site.
