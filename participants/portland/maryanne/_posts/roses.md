#Stop and Smell the Roses

![alt text](/participants/portland/maryanne/images/bugpinkrose.jpg)

Friday after working on my bug it is time to pause and reflect on why open source is important to me.

At lunch time I went to pick my mail. A magazine that I submit recipes to was in my P O Box. My name is in the magazine as usual but the recipe wasn't there. This is common in the publishing world. That your work gets cut before publication. A year ago I submitted the recipe. Six months ago they asked permission to publish. Now it is not there.

It doesn't work this way in the Open Source World. My name stays with my work. Even if my code breaks the build or gets deprecated I still can find it in history. 

##Yay Open Source
