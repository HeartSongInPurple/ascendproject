###Assigned to a bug! Let the questions begin . . .

I found a bug that has been forgotten by most of the world! Actually, it's a request for a new feature in [Popcorn Maker](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/) to allow custom google map urls to upload/embed in the site. I posted a comment explaining my interest and that I set up the dev environment for it to reproduce it locally with an idea of where to start from there. 

Thankfully, I got a response quickly afterwards by a contributor and then I spent several hours trying to decipher the comment, looking up terms, reviewing node.js, reviewing the code and formulating . . . more questions! It can be discouraging to understand so little but I think learning to ask semi-informed (or at least I spent some time thinking about this and trying to research) questions is invaluable. 

####How to carry on when you don't know what you're doing

	Learn the art of asking questions! Last night I went to a PDXmaptime meetup and there was a discussion about impostor syndrome. I asked how this syndrome applied to people who are inexperienced and new to coding and I was reminded that we're all new and inexperienced at something and that part of the challenge of working in tech is how rapidly technology changes and forces everyone to keep learning. It was comforting to hear more experienced developers and mappers say that one of the best things newbies can do is not be afraid to ask questions (and we're all newbies at something they added). 

	Even asking questions or researching online seems to involve more skill that I thought. I am still learning how to phrase my questions. For help on formulating questions I reread Katherine Wu's blog post on [how to be a better junior developer](http://blog.newrelic.com/2014/04/23/better-junior-developer/) and make it easier for others to help you. She calls asking questions a junior developer's super power.  
	

####What I will do when not working on my bug

	Besides looking for ways to touch up Mozilla and Ascend documentation for newbies and searching for an easier bug to work on (for the joy of completing something!) I will be working on my [OPW](http://gnome.org/opw/) internship application and patch submissions.  Very excited about the prospects of a OPW internship.
