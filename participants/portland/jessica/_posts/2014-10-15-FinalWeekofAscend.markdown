###Onward to the Open Source World! 

So my bug mentor has been very kind to walk me through the google maps feature request and in the meantime I've also been working on another bug in webmaker fixing a back button. I am delighted that contributors have been so generous with their time to help! 

I am amazed at how much this process involves collaborating with others and keeping up frequent communication. Tomorrow I will give a presentation on some reflections I've made on my experience here at Ascend. I will share about how this experience has given me much more confidence in my ability to learn and face the challenges of code & communication in the open source world.  Stay tuned for one more follow up post!

In the meantime I'd like to share how I felt about belonging to the Open Source community before Ascend. I felt very much like this picture below as I attempted to feign comfort among technical contributors and developers at meetups.
