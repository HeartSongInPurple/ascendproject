Today was probably my least productive day ever at Ascend. Everything I tried to do seemed to take forever and typically didn't end up working. I spent most of the day trying to set up Debian on VirtualBox only to have it tell me it couldn't find a suitable kernel. It was a lot of work and a lot of time wasted for sure. I really wanted to apply to OPW but the deadline to apply is right around the corner and I don't want to rush through a contribution and submit a shitty application.

Lunch was fantastic though. Peri, Carmen, Amanda, Candida, Becky and I went back to Los Gorditos. I promise I'm going to quit! It was really good.

I decided to step away from my mess and help someone else. One of my cohort hadn't filed a patch yet so I asked if I could look their bug over and maybe help. They seemed agreeable to that so I read a bit about what they had to do. It seemed pretty straight forward so I told them I would work on it with them tomorrow. We checked out and I stopped up at Whole Foods to get a few things for dinner night. Wayne was nice and picked me up!

Carmen made it to the house before Wayne and I did. He and I headed right for the kitchen and I did what I could to help prep for dinner before the larger group started to show up. We were having spaghetti with meatballs and Italian sausage, salad and Wayne's yummy garlic bread. Tonight we had a great group. Carmen, Alice, Jason, Spencer, John, Lukas, Jenny, Amanda, Savanah, Yenni, Dino, Kronda and the five of us. We unfortunately ran out of food for those who came late. That doesn't typically happen so I felt bad. I had such a nice night though. I love our house full of people. After everyone left, I researched the bug I was going to help with. Andrew looked at it with me and together we came up with a plan.

Today I learned I could work really hard and accomplish nothing. I also learned that it happens sometimes and it's fine because my life is full of wonderful people who make everything better!
