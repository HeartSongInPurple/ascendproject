To be honest week three went by so quick that I, just now in week 5, am going back through my notes to remember what we did. I know it took a few days to download, configure, and get our computers set up for a virtual box to be able to build our own versions of Firefox. We then made our first patch and applied it to our version of Firefox. This is what my patch looked like:

 And that was week three in the smallest of nutshells.
