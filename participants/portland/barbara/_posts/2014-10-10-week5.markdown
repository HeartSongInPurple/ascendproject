It’s already Friday?!? 

We had a great day, Tuesday-ish, learning presentation tools with Dia Bondi (I 
probably haven’t gotten her name quite right).

I’m waiting to hear more on my second patch submission, and I made a third 
today that I should probably revise a bit, since it splits one file into 
two new ones, and the patch properly shows only the two new added files.

I aspire to get going on an OPW application this weekend...
