My [first bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1069325) [landed!](https://hg.mozilla.org/qa/mozmill-tests/rev/f17ca5e4fae9)

Earlier this week, we enjoyed great talks by [Marina Zhurakhinskaya](https://wiki.gnome.org/MarinaZhurakhinskaya) about [Gnomeâ€™s](http://www.gnome.org/) [Outreach Program](http://www.gnome.org/opw/) and by [Lars Lohn](http://www.twobraids.com/) about Firefox crash reporting and analysis, based on his [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/) talk, [When Firefox Faceplants&mdash;what the fox says and who is listening](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1319).

And I found out a lot more about the Outreach Program, on IRC, #opw on irc.gimp.net, many thanks to mvolz and fhocutt!
