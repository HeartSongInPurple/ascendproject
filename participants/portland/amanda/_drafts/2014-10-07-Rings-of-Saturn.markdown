Today's post is named after my burgeoning latte art.  I do think it deserves my appreciation due to the result of this art getting me through the second half of the morning.
I think I mentioned the Cadillac of an espresso machine that we have been learning on (note to self:  take picture of espresso machine before the project is over.  It's so beautiful!).  I no longer feel that hole in my experience of growing up in the PacNW and never having done my obligatory stint as a barista on a professional machine!  Thank you Mozilla PDX office :)

This morning started with a Vidyo mentoring session working on Appmaker.  Awesome!  I am still blown away at the time, consideration and patience these experienced devs give us when working on our individual bugs.  k88hudson
