got a bug to work on!

Googled: how to edit css in the browser.  (found this short firefox tutorial mid-way through the search page.  Of course Google Chrome is going to use up the first five entries when I use a Google search.  Note 
to self:  Update default search to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)).



**** each bug is so different.
yesterday, I was working in Angular.js
I helped mary anne with a bug in Vue.js
Today, I'm facing my other nemesis: CSS.  The fun part, I am documenting above.

Also, each bug has it's own dev env to set up!  I guess there will be no ONE-BUG-PER-DAY happening for me on the Ascend Project.  Perhaps that can be my post-course project until I find a J-O-B?
