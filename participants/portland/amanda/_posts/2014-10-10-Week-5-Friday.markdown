It's Friday afternoon, T-minus 2 minutes until the kiddo arrives.  I'm so excited :)

My pull request was merged this morning....

yay!  bug squashed.  The super great thing about contributing to Mozilla projects is all the support and recognition newbies get:

In other news....
I got to spend most of my day on less concentration intesive things such as:
* met with my coach - Larissa is great, bring out the chocolate cake!  She asked me about the lightening talk that I will give on Thursday of next week.  As the talk is only about five minutes long, she basically got the hear the whole thing already.  
* My biggest challenge - as is usually the case - will be to make the information that I'd like to get across less explanatory (ramble), more concise and impactful. 
* Helped fellow ascenders with GitHub issues - fun! 
* Oh!  I reverted my Wordpress site back to the default theme.  We had a great session with Kronda going through how to customize our site.  I will try again with this new knowledge - just not today.  I think this will require a bit of patience and a big stretch from my end.  Anything related to design for me... hmm.... I love UX, I'm not yet confident in design.  (Hey, any fellow Ascenders want their first WP client?   ...jk....)

 Have a great weekend!
