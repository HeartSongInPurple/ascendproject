Hello, welcome to the Mozilla Portland office and the Ascend Project!  We are going to start out with some:

~~Community Building~~

* Meet and build The Team.
	- We came up with these awesome participant [Agreements](http://ascendproject.org/class_agreements/)
* Find your individual strengths.
	- We took a quiz at [Gallup Strengths Center](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=webad&utm_campaign=strengthsdashboard) to determine five areas of our own individual strengths.  Why?  ...to become more engaged, productive and happier! 
* Examine and discuss your strengths.
* Discuss some more and redefine those strengths and OWN them!
* Commit one of those babies to the group.
* Embrace each other.

I completely appreciate this community building and our collective agreements.  Can you find this is a typical tech company/environment?  One could not only hope...and build.

From day one to day five, anxiety transforms into excitement, confidence and it's infectious!  Here is more of what we played with:

 GIT * GitHub * Presentations * Command_Line * [SUMO](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/ "link to Mozilla Support") * [Army of Awesome](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/army-of-awesome/ "Link to Mozilla's Twitter support") * [Mozilla Open Badges](http://www.openbadges.org/) * Firefox Nightly * Aurora * Bash * Presentations * Web Literacy * WebMaker * MoPad / Etherpad * subl * Blog Posts * Twitter * Fair Trade Chocolate * A Cadillac of an espresso machine * Did I mention, Presentations?
