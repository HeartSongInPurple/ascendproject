Here goes another week at the Moz office and I’m getting better! This week was far less coding intensive and we concentrated a lot more on finding/testing bugs, running different versions of Firefox, troubleshooting problems with Firefox, and polishing up our public personas.

In looking for bugs, one thing we did was run Moztrap tests. [Moztrap is a site wherein people can test Mozilla products for bugs and performance issues.](http://moztrap.wordpress.com/) It helps keep users involved in Mozilla products and contributes to the whole open sourceness of Mozilla. We ended up running lots of Moztrap tests this week in search of bugs to file via [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).

The first set of Moztrap tests we did was called One and Done and involved us testing a Mozilla video call program. The first step was to [go to the runtests page at Moztrap](https://moztrap.mozilla.org/runtests/). Once there, choose the type of machine you’re running. Then, select the version of Firefox you’re running. The current version out is 32. That means beta is 33, Aurora is 34, and Nightly is 35. The One and Done tests only exist for Aurora, so I used Aurora to test it. Then you just have to choose which test you want to do.

Note: There are different tests for different versions of Firefox so just make sure you're using the version that you're testing.

Then you have to enter you system info. To find the build, open a new tab in Firefox and type about:config into the url bar. This will take you to a search. Type "buildid" into the search and it will should you a few links with a long string of numbers attached. That number string is the build.

To get software info on a Mac, click the Apple icon in the top left corner. From there scroll to “About This Mac,” followed by “More Info.” At the bottom of the list It will tell you what OS you are running. For me this is OS X 10.9.4.

When you finish filling out all of this info, you can click the green “Run tests” button and go to the next page to find the tests they want you to run. Choose the test, click on it, and follow the instructions. If the test works out, click “Passed.” If it fails, there are two options; “Invalid,” or “Blocked.” Selecting “Invalid” is appropriate when the test was invalid or the rules were unclear or wrong, preventing the test from running properly. “Blocked” is an appropriate response when the test just straight up fails. With both of the latter options, there is a box in which the tester can explain circumstances which were strange or led to the failure of the test, or the failure to properly follow the steps to completing the test.

And voila! You’ve just successfully run Moztrap tests. Here’s your [badge!](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/claim/fjpvxm)
