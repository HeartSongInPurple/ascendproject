Coming into the second week, I began to feel increasingly comfortable with the workspace and my peers. Establishing a safe space & a base of group trust has had an anxiolytic effect on me. Several guest speakers helped to fill out my understanding of the various avenues contributions take, and how Mozilla as an organisation strives to foster an inclusive collaboration environment.

That said, I've realised that some of my perfectionistic tendencies dampen my learning momentum. The fear of appearing incompetent can sometimes override more rational concerns, such as locating good docs or finding software tools that fit me. Despite the trepidation, the curiousity is there, to jump into the unknown, the Wired.
