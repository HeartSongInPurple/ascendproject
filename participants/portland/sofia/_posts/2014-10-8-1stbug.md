[My first bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1051847) simply entailed extending the `about:` whitelist to include itself and a few other items. At first I was tempted to refactor such a long long long regex literal, but I let that go. So, I test my fix in a VM, it works, but when I want to create a patch via git diff > output.patch, I trip myself up: I committed the patch before attempting to use diff. Thus, I learned the importance of avoiding premature committment (and of `git diff --staged`).

Now I have to find a bug that will make for a better presentation o_O
