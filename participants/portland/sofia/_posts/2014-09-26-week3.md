It wasn’t until this week that I felt at home with all of the tools/best practices introduced thus far. My re-exposure to social media via Twitter & Github is going well. I feel wary of establishing any sort of paper trail and having comments/content/code attached to my name. I’ve always felt more comfortable as an anonymous commenter.

I fought some pathname issues in my WordPress install. WP has so many features that I don’t want to touch it for a bit. Shellshock happened and all the Ascenders had to update our bashes (maybe I’ll switch to zsh?).

Poring through Bugzilla tickets (mostly w/ the help of Bugs Ahoy), I feel trepidation. As in, (A): I want to write in something I already know (B): I want to strike a balance between easy/motivating.
