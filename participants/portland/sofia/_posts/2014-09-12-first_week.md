My First Week
===============================
### The Mozilla Milieu

This space is vibrant, conscientious, supportive, &c. I've never committed to a 9-5 and as a result felt trepidation at first. But from the outset, the unwavering support and opportunities for group collaboration instilled a halcyon vibe.




### Major Topics Covered:

1. Mozilla: What We Do, Why It's Important

2. Git(Hub): the Stupid VCS

3. Crafting an Online Presence
