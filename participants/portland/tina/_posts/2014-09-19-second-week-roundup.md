So this second week was an adventure.
I don't really remember everything we did, I just know that I'm exhausted from it.
I finished up a tutorial on running multiple Firefoxes on the same machine.
You can find that post [here-ish](http://ascendproject.org/participants/portland/tina/2014/09/18/using-multiple-types-of-firefox/).
If you follow the tutorial, make sure you grab the badge associated with it [here](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/claim/wnraer).

It may have not been this week, but I did file my first ever bug with mozilla!
The bug is even in release firefox!
Check it out at [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1068354).


Recently, I ran my first mozmill tests.
I'm not sure exactly what it says, but you can check it out [here](http://mozmill-crowd.blargon7.com/#/functional/report/2f982f72826307fed840a3b11c92edde).
I think it's saying that all the tests passed, so shoutout to the Firefox dev team for being on point.
