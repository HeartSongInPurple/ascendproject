##Second Week: The Ups and Downs

The problem with writing these posts on Fridays is that the weeks are so jam packed, I can never remember what Monday was like by the time Friday rolls around. 

The first sign that this week was a much more jam packed one is the minimal amount of crocheting I got done. Since I am here to learn and not to crochet, that is a good thing. This week we spent some more time with git, the command line, testing (both manual and automated) and reporting bugs. 

You can see an example of a automatic test bug report, you can see one [here](http://mozmill-crowd.blargon7.com/#/functional/report/2f982f72826307fed840a3b11c3b92b3 "testing_link").

In other news, I also wrote a tutorial on creating multiple profiles for Firefox [here](http://ascendproject.org/participants/portland/eva/2014/09/18/Firefox_Profile_Tutorial/ "testing_link")
