#No energy left for a clever title

Today was an accidentally exciting day. Yesterday I spent hours and hours and hours (ok, realistically, it was more like and hour and a half, but it felt like forever) trying to apply my patch to my Firefox build on my virtual machine. 

This morning I picked right back up where I left off and I managed to break my initial Firefox installation. So then I decided to spend another chunk of time trying to repair what I had broken. Right before lunch I threw my hands up in the air and just build a new Firefox installation. 

Kronda gave a presentation on being a business owner, which gave me plenty of time for the build to do its stuff. Then I spent another 30 minutes playing around trying to apply the %&$#@$% patch. 

After the second build, things went much more smoothly. I think it only took me another 20-30 minutes to get the patch applied and then the festivities began (by which I mean I rewarded myself with some They Might be Giants).

Now I am completely caught up and I am now free to devote all of my time and attention towards working on my bug.
