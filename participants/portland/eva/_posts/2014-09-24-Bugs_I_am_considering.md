##To all the bugs I've loved before

I stumbled upon a series of bugs that are kind of intriguing me. All of them are in the Thunderbird add-on Lightning. Specifically, they are: 

*[361983](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=361983 "361983") 
*[373562](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373562 "373562")
*[621540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621540 "621540")

I think the reason they intrigued me is because I find add-ons kind of challenging and interesting since 1Password uses them and I am still trying to figure out how they work (and by how I mean technically not functionally, which I already know). 

I have already started by trying to figure out who the add-on developer is. I have gone to his blog and Mozillians page and checked him out on Twitter. My next step will be forking the code and seeing if I can make any sense of it.
