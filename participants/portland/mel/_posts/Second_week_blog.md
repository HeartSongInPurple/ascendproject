Second week blog
    Monday Sept. 15
    	Worked on creating badges.   Others got mine so I know that it went out.   Not sure I downloaded all 20 as that would be the max.   May work on awarding badges where the recipient has to "pass" a test, not just claim it.

      This is one of the best aspects of the Ascend Project.  Getting a presentation/visit from Mozillians and others in their field.
      One thing I gained is that if a bug/glitch happens on a browser - - Report it!  It could prevent someone else from having the same problem and you will likely know more about why this happens/keeps happening.

Thurs 9/18
      Automated bug tests.  Fancy stuff and the setup isn't simple but it can sure save a lot of work, especially the repetitive, tedious stuff.  Mozmill is what we learned today.  I needed help setting this up.  All the computer stuff is still AnotherWorld-foreign to me.

    this is the results of the Mozmill automated testing on Thurs 9-18:

    One thing I wanted to do was to log into IRC outside of class.  Will check into this.
    Today we were looking into the Mozmill test.   How to make repetitive tasks easier and a great tool for testing sites and debugging.  And Crash Me  and program that actually crashes the browser.
