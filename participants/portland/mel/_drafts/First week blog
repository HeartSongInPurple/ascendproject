First week blog
    I didn't post this?     Well, this is the start - to be filled as the file is found.
    Lost it somewhere.     
    The class is moving along fast,  going through a Gallup Strengths Survey on the first day.  Giving back-to-back presentations on Tuesday & Weds.   the first on giving an oral on Mozilla websites and details on Git commands on Day 3.
    Ok  will save this and get back to it later.


    Note to future week:
