Today, we got to participate in an amazing info session with Marina from the Outreach Program for Women!  She encouraged us to explore various pathways to contribute to OPW's mission by applying to participate in this round of internships.

We've been having a vivid discussion on the IRC channel #opw (server irc.gimp.net) about past interns who've made contributions, what their work has looked like, and how their work can help inform new ideas for upcoming projects.

Check out [this resource](http://www.irchelp.org/) for getting started with IRC.

[OPW's website](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen) has all the amazing details about OPW's inspiring Open Source adventure program!

In order to apply to be an intern with OPW, we need to make significant contributions to one of the partner agencies, through mentoring, collaborating with people who are involved or who have been involved with the program, researching the projects and relevant languages, reporting bugs, and submitting patches to fix bugs.

An amazing suggestion Marina shared with us was to identify past contributors to OPW, read about their documentation and what changes they made to the project with their contributions, and explore the places they're living and working now.  She said there's a lot of pressure involved, and high expectations for us to do a good job, but there's a lot of room for growth, and there's a lot of support from the project teams.

There are coding projects available and non-coding contributions, such as design and educational content.  Personally, I'm really excited to apply to work with Wikimedia.  It would be so nice to design or improve educational materials, but I am feeling anxious about the level of intensive coding skill that must be necessary for the internship.

The real-time experience of the projects will be very helpful for future job opportunities as well!

I just hope I can improve my skills in documentation and keeping track of what I've learned, what I've done, and how I learned to do it.

Today is a day for catching up on our many projects.  In fact, I have so many projects going on right now that I've made list after list of things to do, but all of my lists are in different places.  I've heard about [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) as a resource for keeping all your notes in one place.  I would like to transfer my notes, but it will take a while to figure it out.
