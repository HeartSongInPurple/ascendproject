There are several bugs I have been reviewing as potential first bugs for my contributions.

[This toggle control bug](https://github.com/mozillafordevelopment/webmaker-app/issues/166) seems interesting because the poster requests a toggle to be created with certain specifications.

I figured that with some research in CSS, if I already knew what the toggle looked like, and its dimensions, I would be able to code the toggle into a special file.

However, one thing I have learned about fixing bugs is that there are dozens of smaller steps underneath the steps I notice first.

I have to set up environments, download files, configure settings, and communicate about my progress, all while trying to remember to eat and sleep.

I am having some confusion about CSS because I am not skilled enough yet to set up the background to make the style sheet look the way I would like.  Still, it's definitely something I want to learn!
